## Desprciption

Nasa Liquor Store is local mom and pop liqour store located on the south side Houston about 5 minutes away from NASA. I got the idea to create this website for the owner after finding out they did not have a way to keep track of their inventory in a efficeint manor. I decided to put my skills to the test and create this site to help them out.
